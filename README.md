# All About Kai Kalma

## 1. Introduction:
My name is Kai Kalma and I am in 10th grade. I live in Chatsworth, California. Another important thing about me is that I play volleyball for both club and highschool. I have 2 dogs, 1 cat, 2 tortises, 1 gecko, and 1 older brother.

## 2. Summer Activities:
Some activities that I did over summer was play volleyball in Florida for a national tournament. We got 15th place in our division for club. I also went to Hawaii for 5 weeks and worked with dolphins there. We stayed with our friends who live there and it was super fun. I made a total of $1,650 for working at Dolphin Quest. I worked at the front desk and took peoples pictures and helped in the water with the dolphins as well. Here is the link to the place that I worked at. (https://dolphinquest.com/)

## 3. New Skills Learned:
One new skill that I learned this summer was how to take pictures using a professional camera. I learned this in Hawaii when I took pictures at Dolphin Quest. Another skill that I learned this summer was about dolphin anatomy and species. 

## 4.  Volunteer Work or Community Service: 
Some voulenteer work that I did in Hawaii was "Adopt a Highway" and a beach cleanup. These were both in Hawaii and was very pretty. This was the highway that we helped clean ![Highway outside of Puako](https://www.to-hawaii.com/big-island/cities/images/puako/puako_beach_drive.jpg)
